## Question:

```
the python script
Line 1: print("Hello")
Line 2: printf("Hello)

here when this code is run unlike which will throw syntax error
Python 1st line and then throw syntax error so the entire process of parsing,ast,semantic analysis is line by line and the execution by PVM also
```

---

### üß† Given Code:

```python
# Line 1
print("Hello")

# Line 2 (Error)
printf("Hello)
```

### ‚úÖ What Actually Happens Internally in Python?

Python **does NOT parse or compile line-by-line during script execution**. It follows this pipeline:

---

### üîÅ Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. **Lexical Analysis, Parsing & AST Generation (Whole Script)**

- Python **reads the entire source file** (or block) at once.
- Converts it into **tokens**, builds an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.
- **All lines are parsed in one go**, not line-by-line.
- If there's a **syntax error anywhere**, it will fail before any bytecode is generated or executed.

BUT ‚Äî in your example, `printf("Hello)` is a **NameError**, **not** a syntax error.

‚ùóÔ∏è**Exception**: If it were a **missing quote like**:

```python
print("Hello)
```

Then yes, this would be a **syntax error**, and you'd see:

```
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
```

‚Üí In that case, **bytecode isn‚Äôt even generated**. Parsing stops there.

---

#### 2. **Bytecode Compilation (If No Syntax Errors)**

- If syntax is correct, Python compiles everything into **bytecode (.pyc)**.
- Again, this is **not line-by-line**, but at a **function/module block level**.

---

#### 3. **Execution by PVM (Now it's Instruction-by-Instruction)**

- If compilation succeeds, **execution starts** ‚Äî now **line 1 is run**.
- When line 2 runs and sees `printf`, which is **undefined**, Python throws:

```
NameError: name 'printf' is not defined
```

Because:

- **The PVM is now running instructions** step-by-step.
- It successfully executes line 1.
- When it hits line 2 (invalid function), it throws **NameError** at runtime.

---

### üîç So Why Does It Seem Like It Executes Line 1 First?

Because:

- There's **no syntax error** in the file. So parsing and compilation succeed.
- Then, **bytecode is generated**.
- Then, **PVM runs it from the top** ‚Äî line 1 executes, prints "Hello".
- Then **line 2 fails at runtime**, not during parsing.

---

### üî• Summary Table

| Stage                      | Processed Line-by-Line?       | When it Fails in This Case       | Notes                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Parsing (Syntax Check)** | ‚ùå No                         | Only if syntax error exists      | Entire file is parsed at once |
| **Bytecode Compilation**   | ‚ùå No                         | Only if parsing succeeds         | Per function/module           |
| **PVM Execution**          | ‚úÖ Instruction-by-instruction | Runtime error (e.g. `NameError`) | Executes from top to bottom   |

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

So:

- **Python does NOT parse/compile line-by-line**.
- It **parses the whole file**, generates bytecode **if no syntax errors**, and **then** executes from top down.
- You see line 1 execute only because line 2 has a **runtime error**, not a **syntax error**.
